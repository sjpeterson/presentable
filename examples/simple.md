# Presentable

A simple example

## Bullet lists

- Slides can contain a bullet list
- The bullet lists can be nested
  - This is the first child item
  - This is the second child item
  - This is the third child item
- Line continuation is supported, 
  and if the window is too small,
  the slide is split on top-level 
  items

## Plain text paragraphs

Slides can also contain paragraphs
of plain text like this one. Just
like with bullet lists, line
continuation is supported and slides
that are too large to fit the window
are split between paragraphs

Individual paragraphs are drawn with
one row of padding in-between.

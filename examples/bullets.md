Bullet list example

## A Bullet List Slide

- This example highligts some features of bullet list slides
- Markdown line-continuation 
  is supported
  for as many lines as you please

## A Bullet List Slide With Nesting

- Bullet lists can be nested
  - To any depth
    - But of course
      - Too deep, and it gets ridiculous
        - Really
  - Bullet markers are different depending on the nesting level
    * They do not depend on which markers are used in the Markdown document
- If a bullet list needs to be split to fit the window, it will split on
  top-level items only

## Bullet List Markers

- All of the bullet list markers from Markdown are supported, i.e.
  + -
  + +
  + *
- You cannot mix markers on the same list
  * Using different markers for different sublists at the same level is fine,
    however
